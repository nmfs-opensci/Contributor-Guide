# Code of Conduct

See the NMFS Open Sci Code of Conduct [here](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/.github/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

# Contributing

## Ways to contribute

For public repositories, anyone can contribute issues and discussions (if enabled). Public repositories can also be forked and a pull-request submitted.

Only NOAA staff (with current NOAA email) can be an owner of a repository on nmfs-opensci or be a contributor with direct push permissions. Non-NOAA GitHub users can be added as contributors to public and private repositories, but with review turned on (i.e. no direct push access).

## NOAA users

NOAA staff who wish to contribute to nmfs-opensci

* need to have 2FA turned on
* should review the NMFS GitHub Checklist which outlines the types of material that are not allowed on GitHub

Then contact the nmfs-opensci admins to discuss the repository you would like to create and manage on nmfs-opensci.

## Disclaimers and licenses

See the [template repo](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/NOAA-blank) for the standard disclaimers to include on repositories. See the [NMFS GitHub Guidelines](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/GitHub-Guide/#github-repository-components) section on Readme, disclaimers and licenses. All repositories created on nmfs-opensci will also have the Code of Conduct added to the repository; this happens automatically.

## NOAA branding

The nmfs-opensci GitHub organization is not intended for official NOAA communications and NOAA logos should not generally be used on repositories. 


# Maintenance and Archiving

## GitHub Pages

You will need to turn on GitHub Pages if desired using Settings > Pages.  See the [NMFS R UG repo](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/NMFS-R-UG) of a Distill website with
a GitHub Action that builds the page automatically. See the [Resource Book](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/ResourceBook) as an example of a Quarto website with a GitHub Action to build the page.

## Issues and Discussion

Repository owners are welcome to use these features. However if you do not need them, you might want to turn them off. The nmfs-admins will not be monitoring issues or discussions on repositories.

## Back-ups

The nmfs-opensci admins do not provide back-ups of content and cannot guarantee the content on the GitHub organization will persist.
Repository owners should back-up content outside of the nmfs-opensci GitHub organization.

## Archiving

The nmfs-opensci admins reserve the right to archive repository content that is no longer in use or that is abandoned. The admins may also re-organize content that was created for teaching, talks, or workshops.
